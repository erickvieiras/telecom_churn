# Customer Analysis Indicators

The 'Customer Analysis Indicators' project is a data solution for a fictitious small/medium-sized Telecom company.

The main objective is to parameterize the KPI's and apply an ML model to determine customer evasion based on their behavior.

The company provides various services such as Internet, Telephone, Backup Online and Streaming.

In addition to offering different plans, including the possibility of dependents, it offers flexible contracts with prices and payment methods that can be adjusted to the customer's needs. The business model works in B2C, with a diversified service portfolio with services:

1 - Domestic and business wired and wireless communication networks with analogue internet (Cable), DSL and fiber optics.

2 - Telephone services with multiple lines with short and long distance calling plans.

3 - Movie, TV and Music Streaming Services.

4 - Device protection service.

5 - Online Storage and Backup.

# Metrics

Among the metrics that have a residual impact on whether or not you keep customers in your base, we can highlight some such as:

1 - Customers by status (Active or inactive)

2 - Customers by type of contract, product and technology

3 - Customers by type of billing and average monthly payment.

4 - Clients who have dependents and additional services.

5 - Cancellation by reagial and locations due to customer activity and inactivity.

# Top 10 Insights

Among some insights from the project, we can highlight:

1 - Base customers who have dependents and only telephone represent a rate of 394% more than customers with only internet. Customers who have dependents and only telephone represent only 20% more than internet-only customers.

2 - Base customers with dependents who have Analog (Cable) technology pay 10% more compared to fiber optic technology, which is the only one that makes telephone viable.

3 - Customers who have a premium service (Online Backup, Device Security, Streaming, Internet and Telephone) pay only 59% more compared to customers who only have Internet/Telephone.

4 - Analogy (Cable) technology customers pay just 5.9% less than Fiber Optic customers, as well as DSL customers.

5 - The rates of canceled customers who are dependent on Analog (Cable) technology represent only 8.4% compared to Fiber Optic technology.

6 - The customer base rate with DSL technology represents only 52% compared to Fiber optic technology. Analog technology (Cable) represents only 23% compared to optical fiber.

7 - The city with the highest cancellation rate is Los Angeles, which represents a rate of 2.74% on the number of active customers on the base.

8 - Customers who do not have dependents and have a monthly contract request termination more than customers who use another contractual modality. A rate of almost 930% compared to customers using an annual contract.

9 - Customers who use digital invoices tend to have a contractual termination rate of 370% higher than customers who receive paper invoices.

10 - Base customers tend to pay more in cash, in proportion to the customers who cancel. The least used method is by mailed check.

# Final Product

The purpose of the project is to create an analytical Dashboard with a set of metrics not yet defined by the company, to assist in decision making, strategic business analysis, company assets and predict the tendency to terminate the contract based on customer behavior.
